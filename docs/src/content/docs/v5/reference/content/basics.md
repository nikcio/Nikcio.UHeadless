By utilizing these content basics, you can extend existing content models and tailor them to your specific application requirements. These basics serve as the foundation for modifying and enhancing the data of content model within Nikcio.UHeadless. They allow you to add custom properties and handle content redirection.

Note that the content basics should be used for extending existing models, and it's not recommended to use them for creating entirely new content models from scratch. The existing models provide a solid foundation, and extending them through the content basics offers flexibility and customization options without reinventing the wheel. If you want to create your content model from scratch you want to use a [base model](../bases).
