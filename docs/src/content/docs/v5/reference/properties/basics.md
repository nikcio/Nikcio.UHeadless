In Nikcio.UHeadless, property basics provide a way to extend existing models and customize their behavior by adding additional properties and functionality. These basics allow you to modify and enhance the behavior and data structure of property models according to your specific requirements. The following table presents the available property basics along with a brief description:

By utilizing these property basics, you can extend existing property models and tailor them to your specific application requirements. These basics serve as the foundation for modifying and enhancing the data of property model within Nikcio.UHeadless. They allow you to add custom properties.

Note that the property basics should be used for extending existing models, and it's not recommended to use them for creating entirely new property models from scratch. The existing models provide a solid foundation, and extending them through the property basics offers flexibility and customization options without reinventing the wheel. If you want to create your property model from scratch you want to use a [base model](../bases).
