# Unsupported editors

* Umbraco Grid editor
  * The Umbraco Grid editor is not supported because it's a soon deprecated editor and there's been no great way of adding the data to the GraphQL while still maintaining the features other editors have. If you'd like to implement your own model and extract the raw value yourself see this PR: [#90](https://github.com/nikcio/Nikcio.UHeadless/pull/90).
