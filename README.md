## Versioning

Nikcio.UHeadless follows the principles of Semantic Versioning to ensure consistency. The version numbers have the following meaning:

```
vX.Y.Z
```

- X (Major): Indicates a breaking change.
- Y (Minor): Signifies a feature change.
- Z (Patch): Represents bug fixes.

It is important to note that the versioning of Nikcio.UHeadless does not align with Umbraco's major versions. To manage compatibility, the following versioning tactic has been adopted:

### Versioning Tactic

Each Umbraco LTS (Long-Term Support) version is associated with a corresponding UHeadless LTS version. Any other UHeadless majors that are not marked as LTS will cease to receive support when a new major version is released. This approach allows you, as a developer, to choose the frequency of updates for both UHeadless and Umbraco.

The versioning tracks are as follows:

| Track           | UHeadless Version | Supported Umbraco Version |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| LTS             | v3.x.x            | v10.x.x & v11.x.x         |
| Edge            | v5.x.x            | v11.x.x & v12.x.x         |

Please note that LTS versions do not receive new features but will receive bug fixes when a newer major version is available.
