This repository creates an easy setup solution for making Umbraco headless. It comes with a wide range of extensibility options that can be tailored to your needs.

## Works on

* Umbraco 9 (v1.x.x & v2.x.x)
* Umbraco 10 (v2.x.x & v3.x.x)
* Umbraco 11 (v3.x.x)

See more under [Versioning](#Versioning)

## Setup

### Install the package:

```
dotnet add Nikcio.UHeadless
```

_Find it on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nikcio.UHeadless)_

### Add the extensions to the `Startup.cs` file:

```CSharp
using Nikcio.UHeadless.Extensions;

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddUmbraco(_env, _config)
                /* Code obmitted for clarity */
                .AddUHeadless()
                /* Code obmitted for clarity */
        }

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    /* Code obmitted for clarity */

    app.UseUHeadlessGraphQLEndpoint();

    app.UseUmbraco()
    /* etc... */
}
```
Now your content will be avalible at `/graphql`

To get started try adding some content to the root and run the following query:
```graphql
{
  contentAtRoot {
    nodes {
      id,
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Versioning
UHeadless following to the best of abillity Semantic Versioning. This means that the version numbers have the following meaning

vX.Y.Z

* X (Major - Breaking change)
* Y (Minor - Feature change)
* Z (Patch - Bug fixes)

This also means that versions doesn't follow Umbracos major versions.
To avoid supporting to many major versions the following versioning tactic has been choosen.

### Versioning tactic

Each Umbraco LTS version will have a accompanying LTS UHeadless version. All other UHeadless majors not marked as LTS will stop support when a new major is released.
In this way you as a developer can choose how often you expect to be updating UHeadless and Umbraco.

The two versioning tracks can be found in the table here:

| Track | UHeadless version | Supported Umbraco version |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|
|  LTS  |      v3.x.x       |     v10.x.x & v11.x.x     |
|  Edge |      v3.x.x       |     v10.x.x & v11.x.x     |
|  Current stable | v3.x.x  |     v10.x.x & v11.x.x     |

**Do note that LTS versions will not actively get new featues but will be bugfixed when a newer major is present**
