# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.

## [8.0.0-preview001](https://github.com/nikcio/Nikcio.UHeadless/compare/v7.0.1...v8.0.0-preview001) (2025-02-12)

### Breaking changes

* Updated Hotchocolate from version 13 to version 15
  This changes some behavioral aspects of Hotchocolate. Mainly it now responds with 200 OK in many more cases of a failed request. Also Hotchocolate now uses defaults cost analyzers, but to maintain the best backwards compatibility in the package this has been disabled in the Nikcio.UHeadless package and shouldn't be a concern.

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/nikcio/Nikcio.UHeadless/compare/v4.0.0-preview002...v4.0.0) (2023-06-12)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Removes the redundant `TProperty` argument from classes where it's not needed which simplifies the classes quite a bit.

### Features

* Added mapping key methods to property map ([36bd25e](https://github.com/nikcio/Nikcio.UHeadless/commit/36bd25e10f4a2cae8aad8df7e182698f39c43d2d))

## [4.0.0-preview002](https://github.com/nikcio/Nikcio.UHeadless/compare/v4.0.0-preview001...v4.0.0-preview002) (2023-06-07)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Removes the `UseSecurity` option. The naming is confusing on what it does and the developer should control the authentication and authorization themself to have greater control over their application.

### Features

* Allow `BasicMember` with generic properties ([abf399d](https://github.com/nikcio/Nikcio.UHeadless/commit/abf399dcbb8508ef27c5f526e0cbf134961d43a1))


* Removes the `UseSecurity` option ([530870a](https://github.com/nikcio/Nikcio.UHeadless/commit/530870a1fec4613eb11cd6b3b9c637f50aad60cf))

## [4.0.0-preview001](https://github.com/nikcio/Nikcio.UHeadless/compare/v3.3.0...v4.0.0-preview001) (2023-06-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Renamed `AllMembers` query to `MembersAll` to have similar naming as the rest of the queries.
* Some namespaces wasn't synced properly to the location of the files. So to avoid confusion over source files the namespaces has been synced. New namespaces:

BasicBlockListItem - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.BlockList.Models`
BasicBlockListModel - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.BlockList.Models`
BasicContentPicker - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.ContentPicker.Models`
BasicContentPickerItem - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.ContentPicker.Models`
BasicDateTimePicker - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.DateTimePicker.Models`
BasicPropertyValue - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.Fallback.Models`
BasicMediaPicker - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.MediaPicker.Models`
BasicMediaPickerItem - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.MediaPicker.Models`
BasicMemberPicker - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.MemberPicker.Models`
BasicMemberPickerItem - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.MemberPicker.Models`
BasicMultiUrlPicker - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.MultiUrlPicker.Models`
BasicMultiUrlPickerItem - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.MultiUrlPicker.Models`
BasicNestedContent - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.NestedContent.Models`
BasicNestedContentElement - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.NestedContent.Models`
BasicRichText - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.EditorsValues.RichTextEditor.Models`
PropertyMapExtensions - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.Maps.Extensions`
BasicProperty - `Nikcio.UHeadless.Base.Basics.Models`
* Member queries have been split to separate models which removes `BasicMemberQuery`.
* Media queries have been split to separate models which removes `BasicMediaQuery`.
* This removes the property queries as they had a weird place in the package and no real use. (You can do the exact same thing with the content queries).
* Media & Members have had culture removed from the query options. It's not possible to create media and members on different cultures and it's therefore not necessary to be able to query for it.

Content & Property queries have had `segment` & `Fallback` added to the query options to better support culture querying.

All `GetValue` for property values have been changed to `Value` which better support culture variants.
* Introduces `IVariationContextAccessor` to the contructor on `BasicContent`
* What was `BasicContentOfBasicPropertyAndBasicContentTypeAndBasicContentRedirect` in v3 schema will now be `BasicContent`. This simplifies the naming of types used in the schema a lot.

Also the integration test schema was updated using `dotnet graphql download https://localhost:44321/graphql`
* The content queries has been given a separate class for each query to help developers only expose the data they need.
* Replace Alias with model on propertyValue
* **deps:** Added min requirement to be Umbraco 11 & .Net 7
* **deps:** Updated to Hotchocolate 13

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Dropped support for Umbraco v9

* Namespace changes
  * Many namespaces have been changed to make it easier to make extending packages. This also means that some classes have been moved to completely different namespaces.
  * If you need to find a class's new location, look in the docs or use the search feature on GitHub.
  * Example:
    * `using Nikcio.UHeadless.UmbracoContent` --> `using Nikcio.UHeadless.Content`

* Querying properties have been changed. See [How to query properties](docs/v3/querying/properties.md).

* The `PropertyValue` which is a basis for all property values now always includes an Alias. This is to support the new Property querying with fragments. See [How to query properties](docs/v3/querying/properties.md).

* `AddPropertyMapDefaults` has been removed from `IPropertyMap` this now

* `GetProperties` has been changed to `GetContentItemsProperties` on the `IPropertyRespository`

* The `Value` property on `BasicProperty` has been changed from `object` to `PropertyValue` to support the new querying. See [How to query properties](docs/v3/querying/properties.md).

* `ContentQuery` now takes a new generic parameter `TContentRedirect` of type `IContentRedirect` for redirect information.

* `GetContentByRoute` has been removed. Use `GetContentByAbsoluteRoute` instead.

* Updated the naming of the queries to include what is being queried.

Example:
To get content at root you previously used atRoot this is now contentAtRoot

List:
atRoot --> contentAtRoot
byId --> contentById
byGuid --> contentByGuid
atRoute --> contentAtRoute

New:
propertiesAtRoute
propertiesById
propertiesByGuid

The new queries uses the same values for fetching properties but gives an eaiser way to do filtering, paging and sorting.
